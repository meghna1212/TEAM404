# CV ANALYSIS AND SCREENING SOFTWARE

## Project Overview 
This CV Analysis and Screening Software is a Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing based application. 

In today’s day and age, selecting the right candidate for an organization through the recruitment 
process, from a vast pool of candidates, has become a fundamental issue. The traditional norm 
has been to conduct various personality and technical evaluation tests, which can be extremely 
time-consuming and can lead to selection of an unfit candidate. 

Through this software, we aim to create a system which will provide an effective way to short 
list submitted candidate CVs from a large number of applicants and help in providing a 
consistent and fair CV ranking policy. It will rank the CVs according to the candidate’s 
experience and key skills required for particular job position. 
This system will ultimately help reduce the workload of the hiring department and select the 
right candidate for the desired job profile, which in turn provide the expert for the organization
